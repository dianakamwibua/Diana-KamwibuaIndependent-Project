    <div class="Week1"
    <p>This is what l have been upto all week. I did a few practice projects and deployed them on liveserve.</p>
    <p>I was surprised by some of it, however l think i can do more</p>
    </div>
    <div class="aboutdiana">
    <p>I am a farmer and l run a feedlot owned by my family.</p>
    <p>I specialise in Boran cattle.The Boran developed into the dominant breed of eastern Africa and especially in Kenya, where the Kenyan Boran Cattle Breeders' Society (BCBS) have bred the "Improved Boran" since the turn of the century </p>
    <p>Boran cattle are quiet hardy and prevalent to dry weather thats why the are ideal for my trade</p>
    <p>On a normal day, my job is to make sure we have feed and water for the cattle and most important we have a ready market for them</p>
    <p> On top of all this we have frequent buyers into the farm to purchase</p>

    <h2>But before all this</h2>
    <p>I am a UoN Alumni with a background in Finance.</p>
    <p>I was a banker at Barclays Bank (now ABSA) for 6 years before l left to be self employed</p>
    <p>THe decison to quit my well paying job and venture into a very erratic market was faced with a lot of uncertainity and mixed feelings of fear and faith</p>
    <p>But you know what they say, "don't elt the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game"</p>
    <p>so l took a leap of faith and did it</p>
    <p>THe first year of business was baptism by fire but l finally managed to find my footing</p>
